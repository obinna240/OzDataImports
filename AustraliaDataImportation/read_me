1. Go to the Location of your jar i.e pcgAustralia-0.0.1.jar
2. Open Application.properties and set the location of AustraliaDataFile.csv
3. You can also alter the name of your solr core and port etc
4. To run, Assuming the jar is in c:/australia in your cli,
c:\australia>java -jar pcgAustralia-0.0.1.jar --spring.config.location=c:/australia/application.properties

The line above assumes that the location of applicaiton.properties is in c:/australia/application.properties
Note that we use application.properties to set the values of all properties.
In the absence of this, spring will look in 'c:/australiaIndexer/config/AustraliaDatafile.csv' for the csv

Finally, the managed schema has changed.
Delete the index and use the current managed schema.
